## Project Overview

Welcome to the DotNetExtensions.OAuth20.Server.Host project, a comprehensive solution for deploying a fully functional OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server. This repository contains an ASP.NET Core hosted web application that utilizes the core libraries from the [DotNetExtensions.OAuth20.Server](https://github.com/DotNetExtensions/OAuth20.Server) repository to deliver OAuth 2.0 endpoints, UI components, and data storage options.

## Key Features

- **Ready-to-Deploy Application:** Complete OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server with built-in UI and data storage.
- **Cross-Platform Deployment:** Supports deployment via Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and as a Windows Service or IIS application.
- **Integration:** Leverages core and UI libraries from **DotNetExtensions.OAuth20.Server**.
- **User Interfaces:** Includes Blazor-based user-friendly Admin Panel and Personal Account UI for managing OAuth 2.0 consents and configurations.
- **Security Compliance:** Adheres to OAuth 2.0 [RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) with additional security measures.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated workflows using GitHub Actions for building, testing, and release uploading.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Includes integration tests, load tests, demo projects, and configuration samples.

## Getting Started

To get started with DotNetExtensions.OAuth20.Server.Host, follow the installation instructions below to deploy the hosted application.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker (if using containerized deployments)
- Kubernetes (for cluster-based deployments)
- IIS (for IIS installations)

### Docker Installation

To run the OAuth 2.0 Server using Docker, execute:

```bash
docker pull dotnetextensions/oauth20serverhost:latest
