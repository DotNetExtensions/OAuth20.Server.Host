## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

1. [**Search for existing issues**](https://github.com/DotNetExtensions/OAuth20.Server.Host/issues) to avoid duplication.
2. If no issue exists, create a new one via the GitHub Issues section.
3. Provide as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the bug.
   - Steps to reproduce.
   - Expected vs. actual behavior.
   - Environment details (e.g., OS version, .NET version).
   - Relevant screenshots or logs, if applicable.

### Suggesting Enhancements

To propose new features or improvements:

1. [**Create an issue**](https://github.com/DotNetExtensions/OAuth20.Server.Host/issues/new/choose) in GitHub with a detailed description of your idea, including:
   - The reasoning behind the enhancement.
   - How it benefits the project.
   - Any relevant details or examples.

### Contributing Code and Documentation

We welcome contributions to our codebase, documentation, and project files, including fixing bugs, adding new features, improving code quality, and enhancing documentation.

#### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OAuth20.Server.Host.git
   ```

2. **Install required tools and dependencies**:

   - Install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or later).
   - Install any other dependencies as specified in the `README.md` or project documentation.

3. **Build the project** to ensure everything is set up correctly:

   ```bash
   cd src\DotNetExtensions.OAuth20.Server.Host
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Run tests** to confirm the environment is properly configured:

   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

#### Branching Strategy

1. **Update your local `develop` branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Create a new branch** following our branching strategy:

   - For new features or significant updates:

     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name develop
     ```

   - For fixing non-critical issues:

     ```bash
     git checkout -b bugfix/your-bugfix-name develop
     ```

   - For fixing critical issues that require immediate attention:

     ```bash
     git checkout -b hotfix/your-hotfix-name main
     ```

3. **Make your changes** to the code or documentation.

4. **Commit your changes** with clear and descriptive commit messages.

5. **Push your branch** to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

6. **Submit a pull request** to the main repository. All changes made in `feature` and `bugfix` branches should be merged into the `develop` branch, while changes from `hotfix` branches should be merged into the `main` branch via pull requests.

For detailed information on branching strategies (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`), please refer to the [GITFLOW.md](./GITFLOW.md).

#### Commit Messages

- Use **sentence case** for commit messages (start with a capital letter, avoid periods).
- **Format:** `[scope] #issue_number Description of the change`.
  - **Scopes:** Use scopes relevant to the codebase, such as `[feature]`, `[fix]`, `[test]`, `[docs]`, `[config]`, `[workflow]`.
  - **Example:**

    - `[feature] #42 Implement user authentication`
    - `[fix] #55 Resolve deployment configuration error`

- Place the issue number directly after the scope to quickly reference related issues.

#### Pull Requests

- Ensure your pull request is **linked to a GitHub issue** if applicable.
- Use clear, descriptive titles and provide a detailed summary of the changes in the pull request.
- Include the **issue number** in the pull request title and description if it's related to an existing issue.
- Our pull request template includes a checklist; please ensure you review and complete it before submitting.
- **Target the `develop` branch** when creating your pull request (unless it's a hotfix, which should target `main`).
