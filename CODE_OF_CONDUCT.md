# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing for mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments; personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

### Language Policy

To ensure the project maintainers can properly moderate and engage in discussions, all communications, including issues, pull requests, and discussions, must be conducted in **English**. This ensures that moderators and contributors can fully understand and participate in conversations, and that all information remains accessible to everyone involved.

Contributions and discussions in other languages may be declined or redirected to meet this requirement.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate action in response to unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and when an individual is representing the community in public spaces.

## Reporting a Violation

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders at [codeofconduct@dotnetextensions.com](mailto:codeofconduct@dotnetextensions.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences for any action deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Minor inappropriate language or behavior.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning with clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why it was inappropriate.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior, including potential temporary or permanent bans.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** Serious violation of community standards.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from interaction or public communication with the community.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from the community.

## Enforcement Examples

To illustrate how these guidelines may be applied, here are some examples:

- **Example 1: Inappropriate Language**

  A member uses offensive language in a discussion. A community leader issues a private warning, explaining that such language is unacceptable.

- **Example 2: Harassment**

  A contributor sends unwelcome messages to another member. Upon investigation, the community leaders issue a temporary ban.

- **Example 3: Repeated Violations**

  A participant continues to engage in disruptive behavior after warnings. The community leaders decide to enforce a permanent ban.

## Diversity Statement

We celebrate and welcome contributions from everyone. We are committed to promoting an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives are valued.
